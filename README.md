## About

Garage-door-tools is a small set of tools for controlling and
monitoring one's garage door using a connected Raspberry Pi
processor. It consists of three parts:

* control - a Web utility for opening and closing one's garage door
  with moderate security
* minder - a daemon that alerts the owner(s) via SMS if the door has
  been left open
* hardware - details of the hardware used to interface the Raspberry
  Pi processor to the garage door opener
